# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Video-Game-Sales
Data Science IGaming Project.

To complete my Data Analysis project I will be using a dataset about Video Games Sales from years 1980 to 2020.

This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. It was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com. The script to scrape the data is available at https://github.com/GregorUT/vgchartzScrape. It is based on BeautifulSoup using Python. There are 16,598 records.
    
In this dataset there are 11 columns. Their names and data types as follows:

* Rank - Ranking of overall sales

* Name - The games name

* Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)

* Year - Year of the game's release

* Genre - Genre of the game

* Publisher - Publisher of the game

* NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions of units)

* EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions of units)

* JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions of units)

* Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions of units)

* Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales (in millions of units)
